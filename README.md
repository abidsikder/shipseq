# Project Roadmap
- [ ] Scan Amazon orders page and insert carbon estimate next to packages delivered by Amazon
- [ ] Allow users to directly offset carbon estimates using web3 tokens
  - [ ] Keep track of which orders were offset, and insert some sort of indication on the main orders page
- [ ] Redesign logo
- [ ] Restrict which pages extension needs permissions for, only pop up for amazon.com main order page and specific order pages, not return orders
- [ ] Adjust based on package weight and size
- [ ] Add links to more carbon projects
